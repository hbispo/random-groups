# Random groups
Simple page to pick random groups of people, with the option to not repeat previous groups.

## Features
Not much, really. You can type a list of people (or any items, of course) and choose to sort them into groups of 2 (pairs), 3 (trios) or 4 (quartets).

Once sorted for the first time, you're able to download a JSON file with the resulting groups, so they're not repeated in future sortings.

## What's next?
* Custom number of members per group
* Translations (to Brazilian Portuguese first)
* Improvements to the sorting algorithm, especially the part that stops groups from repeating
